Members in attendance:- Oliver, Max

Talked about previous week's work. Max's walking animation was slightly jittery and so needed extra frames, this will be one task for the coming week.

Also managed to export some files from 3ds into a usable form in unity. These are the missing assets from the week commencing 19/10/16 for the ground and grass.

During our meeting with Chris he pointed out some less than optimal uses of code, which were using slow processes and he suggested changing from
instantiation for the rain every time we needed it, and deleting it when we didnt, to instantiating many at the start of the program and then activating/deactivating
as needed.
