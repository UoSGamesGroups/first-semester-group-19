1 piece of Max's work unfinished (this was assigned for 2 weeks) it was taken over by Oliver due to it being a particularly critical piece 
of work which needed to be done by tuesday the 6th December.
2 Pieces of Sam's work were not completed. Both of these were taken over by Oliver so that Sam and Max could do playtesting for the final week.
The playtesting is to be finished by Monday night at the latest.
There has been no time assigned to the playtesting task as the most important thing is to get people to playtest the game (In the hours spent I will
assume that 3 hours were taken as this is how many hours I have given to myself to complete this weeks tasks)
