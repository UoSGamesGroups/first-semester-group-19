Members in attendance:- Oliver, Max

Talked about previous week's work. Max's walking animation was slightly jittery and so needed extra frames, this will be one task for the coming week.
Max did some work on tasks in the backlog rather than on the assigned tasks, and when uploading work, rather than uploading it to the repository he commented
a zip folder with a psd file in it, I have exported the psd into a png and uploaded it to github. One tast was not started. This task has been reassigned for the coming week.
Also the task that was completed, I have closed however it was only half completed, and so I have created a new task to complete the remaining parts of that task.

Also managed to export some files from 3ds into a usable form in unity. These are the missing assets from the week commencing 19/10/16 for the ground and grass.

During our meeting with Chris he pointed out some less than optimal uses of code, which were using slow processes and he suggested changing from
instantiation for the rain every time we needed it, and deleting it when we didnt, to instantiating many at the start of the program and then activating/deactivating
as needed.
Chris also mentioned moving where the functionality of item pickups is to the item rather than the player, so that multiple items can be picked up, rather than just the one that
the player's script is looking for.
