Currently no correspondance from Bogdan.

Discussed 2 ideas, 1 with the ant as the player character, and one concerning a dream state.

For ant idea, emotions being chrysalism and monochopsis, mechanics using rain drops and cover, and the ability for the ant to pick up
items for cover, or to use as a raft for example.

Still no correspondance from Bogdan.
Decided on the tasks for next week, to create some basic art assets and fix some of the basic mechanics of the game.
Discussed the art style with regards to taking inspiration from other games with a similar style eg. limbo
Discussed using hand drawn art that is then imported and edited on photoshop for a unique art style.

Clarified mechanics (what the player does):
	Dodging rain
		Using grass as shelter
		Different ground types affect the player's speed (increases challenge because you will be slower)
	Picking up items and placing them down
		using the same item in multiple ways e.g. placing a leaf behind you to protect from rain rolling down a hill behind you,
		or placing it on the floor to cross a ditch etc.
		possibly adding in a jump/climb to add more depth to using the items


for now focus on the basic mechanics of the rain, and getting the item mechanic (picking up, putting down on the floor) to a satisfactory standard before
continuing with more mechanics/depth
