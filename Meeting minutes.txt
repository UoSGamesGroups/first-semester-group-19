Currently no correspondance from Bogdan.

Discussed 2 ideas, 1 with the ant as the player character, and one concerning a dream state.

Decided on the tasks for next week, to create some basic art assets and fix some of the basic mechanics of the game.
Discussed the art style with regards to taking inspiration from other games with a similar style eg. limbo
Discussed using hand drawn art that is then imported and edited on photoshop for a unique art style.
